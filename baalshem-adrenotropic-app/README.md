# Making Headlines
## Intro to Express

### Background


<img src="daily_planet.jpg">

Weclome to the daily planet, we need your superhuman developer skills to help us share news with the world. We've seen that you have some express knowledge and need you to make us a mock website as soon as possible.

You'll need to use an `sequelize` to create and display articles.

## Routes

You'll need the following `article` routes:

* `get`  `/articles` to display a summary of each article.
* `get` `/articles/new` to get a form to save a new article
* `post` `/articles` to save an article
* `get` `/articles/:id` to find an article by id and displaya it

You'll need the following `author` routes:

  - `get` `/authors` to display all authors in db
  - `get` `/authors/new` to render the form to add a new author
  - `post` `/authors` to save a new author
  - `get` `/authors/:id` to find an author by id in the database

You'll need the following `site` related routes:

* `get` `/` serve the homepage of your site.
* `get` `/about` serve a static about daily planet page.
* `get` `/contact` serve a static `contact` page.

## Structure

All your article related views should be in an `views/articles` folder. Each article should utilize `ejs` to render the page. Your `site` related views `index`, `about`, and `contact` should also have a folder `views/site`. 


## Bonus

Include some navigation links to help the user navigate the site.
